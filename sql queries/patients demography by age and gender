                Management Questions:
What is our patient distribution by age group and gender?

Query:
SELECT 
    AgeGroup,
    Gender,
    COUNT(*) AS patient_count,
    AVG(TreatmentCost) AS avg_treatment_cost
FROM hospital_data
GROUP BY AgeGroup, Gender
ORDER BY AgeGroup, Gender;

              KEY FINDING: 
65+ age group has highest patient volume (~1,500 patients), followed by 19-35 age group. Distribution is fairly balanced by gender.

         RECOMMENDATION:
Developing an  age-specific care programs, especially for elderly patients (65+) who represent largest patient segment,
will help in promoting the health and quality of life of the aging population.
