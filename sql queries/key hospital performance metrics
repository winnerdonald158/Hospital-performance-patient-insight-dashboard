    COUNT(DISTINCT PatientID) AS total_patients,
    AVG(TreatmentCost) AS avg_treatment_cost,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Readmission = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS readmission_rate,
    AVG(CASE WHEN Readmission = 'Yes' THEN ReadmissionCost END) AS avg_readmission_cost
FROM hospital_data;

The Hospital treated 10,000 patients with average treatment cost of $25.5K. Readmission rate is 25.2%.
